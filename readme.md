Sticky
=======

Sticky is a special jQuery plugin that allows conditional fixed positioning of an element. What it allows is having an element in a certain position and once you scroll over that position, sticky that element in a fixed position. Once you scroll above the starting point of that element, the fixed positioning is removed and the element sits tightly where it's supposed to be.

Look through the short&sweet javascript file for more information and let the html file guide your abilities.
